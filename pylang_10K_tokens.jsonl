{"input": "# Introduction to PyLang\n\nPyLang is a modern, high-performance programming language designed to combine the readability of Python with the performance characteristics of compiled languages like Rust and C++. Developed in 2023, PyLang aims to provide developers with a seamless experience for everything from web development to systems programming, machine learning, and data science applications.\n\nThe language was created to address common pain points in existing languages, such as the performance limitations of Python, the complexity of C++, and the steep learning curve of Rust. PyLang features a clean, intuitive syntax that will feel familiar to Python developers, while offering compile-time optimizations, strong type safety, and memory management features that eliminate common runtime errors.\n\nPyLang compiles directly to native machine code, resulting in executables that perform at speeds comparable to C++ while maintaining memory safety guarantees. The language includes a state-of-the-art compiler that performs sophisticated whole-program optimization, including function inlining, loop unrolling, and automatic vectorization.\n\nOne of PyLang's core philosophies is \"progressive complexity\" - simple tasks should be simple to code, while complex, performance-critical code should still be possible when needed. This makes PyLang suitable for beginners and experts alike.\n\nThe PyLang ecosystem includes a comprehensive standard library, an integrated package manager, and tools for testing, documentation, and deployment. The language is open-source, with a vibrant community contributing to its development and creating third-party libraries and frameworks."}
{"input": "# PyLang Core Syntax\n\nPyLang uses a clean, expressive syntax that emphasizes readability while enabling powerful features. Variables are declared using the `let` keyword for immutable bindings and `var` for mutable ones. PyLang is statically typed with powerful type inference, meaning you often don't need to specify types explicitly.\n\n```pylang\n# Variable declarations\nlet name = \"PyLang\"  // Immutable\nvar version = 1.0    // Mutable\nvar users: int = 1000  // With explicit type annotation\n```\n\nFunctions are defined with the `func` keyword, and can include type annotations for parameters and return values:\n\n```pylang\nfunc calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float {\n    return length * width\n}\n\nlet rectangle_area = calculate_area(5.0, 3.0)\nprint(\"The area is: {rectangle_area}\")\n```\n\nPyLang supports string interpolation using curly braces, similar to Python's f-strings. Control flow statements include if/else, match expressions for pattern matching, and various loop constructs:\n\n```pylang\n// If-else statement\nif temperature > 30 {\n    print(\"It's hot outside!\")\n} else if temperature < 10 {\n    print(\"It's cold outside!\")\n} else {\n    print(\"The weather is pleasant.\")\n}\n\n// Match expression (pattern matching)\nlet status_code = 404\nmatch status_code {\n    200 => print(\"OK\"),\n    404 => print(\"Not Found\"),\n    500 => print(\"Server Error\"),\n    _ => print(\"Unknown status: {status_code}\")\n}\n\n// For loop\nfor i in 1..5 {\n    print(\"Iteration {i}\")\n}\n\n// While loop\nvar counter = 0\nwhile counter < 5 {\n    print(\"Counter: {counter}\")\n    counter += 1\n}\n```\n\nPyLang uses curly braces for code blocks and semicolons are optional at the end of statements. Comments use double slashes for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments. Documentation comments use triple slashes, which are processed by the documentation generator."}
{"input": "# PyLang Type System\n\nPyLang features a strong, static type system with powerful inference capabilities. The type system is designed to catch errors at compile time while requiring minimal type annotations.\n\nBasic types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, and `char`. For collections, PyLang provides `List<T>`, `Dict<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, and `Tuple<T1, T2, ...>`.\n\n```pylang\n// Basic types\nlet count: int = 42\nlet pi: float = 3.14159\nlet is_active: bool = true\nlet message: string = \"Hello, PyLang!\"\nlet first_letter: char = 'P'\n\n// Collection types\nlet numbers: List<int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlet scores: Dict<string, int> = {\"Alice\": 95, \"Bob\": 87, \"Charlie\": 92}\nlet unique_ids: Set<int> = {101, 102, 103, 104}\nlet point: Tuple<float, float> = (2.5, 3.7)\n```\n\nPyLang supports algebraic data types through the `enum` keyword, enabling expressive pattern matching:\n\n```pylang\nenum Result<T, E> {\n    Ok(T),\n    Err(E)\n}\n\nfunc divide(a: float, b: float) -> Result<float, string> {\n    if b == 0.0 {\n        return Err(\"Division by zero\")\n    }\n    return Ok(a / b)\n}\n\n// Pattern matching with the match expression\nlet result = divide(10.0, 2.0)\nmatch result {\n    Ok(value) => print(\"Result: {value}\"),\n    Err(message) => print(\"Error: {message}\")\n}\n```\n\nStructs are used to define composite data types, and can include methods through implementations:\n\n```pylang\nstruct Person {\n    name: string,\n    age: int,\n    email: string\n}\n\nimpl Person {\n    // Constructor method\n    func new(name: string, age: int, email: string) -> Person {\n        return Person { name, age, email }\n    }\n    \n    // Instance method\n    func is_adult(&self) -> bool {\n        return self.age >= 18\n    }\n    \n    // Mutating method\n    func celebrate_birthday(&mut self) {\n        self.age += 1\n    }\n}\n\nlet alice = Person::new(\"Alice\", 30, \"alice@example.com\")\nprint(\"{alice.name} is an adult: {alice.is_adult()}\")\n```\n\nPyLang also supports traits (interfaces) for defining behavior that types can implement:\n\n```pylang\ntrait Printable {\n    func to_string() -> string\n}\n\nimpl Printable for Person {\n    func to_string() -> string {\n        return \"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe type system includes generics, type constraints, union types, and type aliases to provide flexibility while maintaining type safety."}
{"input": "# Memory Management in PyLang\n\nPyLang employs a sophisticated memory management system that combines compile-time analysis with a deterministic runtime model. Unlike garbage-collected languages that can introduce unpredictable pauses, PyLang uses a region-based memory management system with ownership semantics inspired by Rust but with significant usability improvements.\n\nVariables in PyLang have clear ownership rules: each value has exactly one owner at a time, and when the owner goes out of scope, the memory is automatically freed.\n\n```pylang\nfunc example() {\n    let data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  // data is allocated here\n    process_data(data)           // data is moved or borrowed here\n}                               // data is automatically freed here\n```\n\nPyLang uses a borrow checker to ensure memory safety at compile time. References can be either mutable or immutable, but not both simultaneously:\n\n```pylang\nfunc update_value(value: &mut int) {\n    *value += 10  // Modifies the original value\n}\n\nfunc print_value(value: &int) {\n    print(\"Value: {*value}\")  // Only reads the value\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    var x = 5\n    update_value(&mut x)  // Mutable borrow\n    print_value(&x)       // Immutable borrow\n    print(\"Final value: {x}\")\n}\n```\n\nUnlike Rust, PyLang incorporates a region inference system that significantly reduces the need for explicit lifetime annotations. The compiler can automatically determine appropriate lifetimes in most cases:\n\n```pylang\nfunc longest(a: &string, b: &string) -> &string {\n    if a.len() > b.len() {\n        return a\n    } else {\n        return b\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor scenarios where ownership tracking is too restrictive, PyLang provides reference-counted smart pointers and weak references:\n\n```pylang\nfunc shared_ownership() {\n    let shared_data = Rc::new([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n    \n    let reference1 = shared_data.clone()  // Increases reference count\n    let reference2 = shared_data.clone()  // Increases reference count again\n    \n    process_shared_data(reference1)\n    process_shared_data(reference2)\n    \n    // Memory is freed when all Rc references go out of scope\n}\n```\n\nPyLang also includes a deterministic garbage collector that can be enabled for specific regions of code where reference cycles might occur. This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds: deterministic memory management by default with optional garbage collection when needed."}
{"input": "# Concurrency in PyLang\n\nPyLang offers first-class support for modern concurrency patterns, designed from the ground up for today's multi-core processors and distributed systems. The core of PyLang's concurrency model is built around lightweight tasks (similar to goroutines in Go) and channels for communication between tasks.\n\n```pylang\nfunc generate_numbers(ch: Channel<int>, max: int) {\n    for i in 1..max {\n        ch.send(i)\n    }\n    ch.close()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    let numbers = Channel<int>()\n    \n    // Spawn a task that runs concurrently\n    spawn generate_numbers(numbers, 10)\n    \n    // Receive values until the channel is closed\n    for num in numbers {\n        print(\"Received: {num}\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPyLang also supports async/await syntax for asynchronous programming, making it easy to write non-blocking code that efficiently uses system resources:\n\n```pylang\nasync func fetch_data(url: string) -> Result<string, Error> {\n    let client = HttpClient::new()\n    return await client.get(url)\n}\n\nasync func process_multiple_sources() {\n    // These requests run concurrently\n    let results = await all([\n        fetch_data(\"https://api.example.com/data1\"),\n        fetch_data(\"https://api.example.com/data2\"),\n        fetch_data(\"https://api.example.com/data3\")\n    ])\n    \n    for result in results {\n        match result {\n            Ok(data) => process_data(data),\n            Err(e) => log.error(\"Failed to fetch data: {e}\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor more complex concurrency patterns, PyLang provides a built-in actor model implementation. Actors are isolated concurrent entities that communicate through message passing, eliminating many common concurrency bugs:\n\n```pylang\nactor Worker {\n    var processed_count: int = 0\n    \n    func process(job: Job) {\n        // Process the job...\n        processed_count += 1\n        print(\"Processed job {job.id}. Total: {processed_count}\")\n    }\n    \n    func get_stats() -> WorkerStats {\n        return WorkerStats { processed: processed_count }\n    }\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    let workers = List<ActorRef<Worker>>::new()\n    \n    // Create 4 worker actors\n    for i in 0..4 {\n        workers.push(Actor::spawn(Worker {}))\n    }\n    \n    // Distribute jobs among workers\n    for job_id in 0..100 {\n        let worker_index = job_id % workers.len()\n        workers[worker_index].send(Worker::process, Job { id: job_id })\n    }\n    \n    // Collect statistics\n    for (i, worker) in workers.iter().enumerate() {\n        let stats = worker.call(Worker::get_stats)\n        print(\"Worker {i} processed {stats.processed} jobs\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPyLang's concurrency model ensures thread safety through the type system, preventing data races at compile time. The runtime includes a work-stealing scheduler that efficiently distributes tasks across available CPU cores for optimal performance."}
{"input": "# PyLang Standard Library\n\nThe PyLang Standard Library provides a comprehensive set of modules and functions designed to address common programming needs while maintaining the language's principles of performance, safety, and clarity.\n\n## Core Types and Collections\n\nThe standard library includes optimized implementations of common data structures:\n\n```pylang\nimport std.collections as collections\n\nfunc collection_examples() {\n    // Dynamic array with O(1) amortized append\n    let vector = collections.Vector::new([1, 2, 3])\n    vector.push(4)\n    \n    // Double-ended queue\n    let deque = collections.Deque::new()\n    deque.push_front(\"first\")\n    deque.push_back(\"last\")\n    \n    // Binary heap (priority queue)\n    let mut heap = collections.BinaryHeap::new()\n    heap.push(3)\n    heap.push(1)\n    heap.push(5)\n    print(heap.pop())  // Prints: 5\n    \n    // Hash map with consistent iteration order\n    let ordered_map = collections.OrderedMap::new()\n    ordered_map[\"key1\"] = \"value1\"\n    ordered_map[\"key2\"] = \"value2\"\n}\n```\n\n## I/O and Filesystem\n\nThe I/O module provides high-performance file operations and path manipulation:\n\n```pylang\nimport std.io as io\nimport std.fs as fs\n\nfunc file_operations() -> Result<(), io.Error> {\n    // Reading a file\n    let contents = try fs.read_to_string(\"input.txt\")\n    print(\"File contents: {contents}\")\n    \n    // Writing to a file\n    try fs.write(\"output.txt\", \"Hello, PyLang!\")\n    \n    // Working with paths\n    let path = fs.Path::from(\"data/config.json\")\n    if !path.exists() {\n        try fs.create_dir_all(path.parent())\n        try fs.write(path, \"{}\")\n    }\n    \n    // Stream-based reading\n    let file = try fs.File::open(\"large_file.txt\")\n    let reader = io.BufReader::new(file)\n    \n    for line in reader.lines() {\n        let line = try line\n        process_line(line)\n    }\n    \n    return Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Networking\n\nThe networking module supports various protocols and paradigms:\n\n```pylang\nimport std.net as net\nimport std.net.http as http\n\nasync func networking_example() -> Result<(), Error> {\n    // HTTP client\n    let client = http.Client::new()\n    let response = try await client.get(\"https://api.example.com/data\")\n    print(\"Status: {response.status}\")\n    print(\"Body: {await response.text()}\")\n    \n    // TCP server\n    let listener = try net.TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:8080\")\n    print(\"Server listening on port 8080\")\n    \n    while let Some(stream) = try await listener.accept() {\n        // Handle each connection in a new task\n        spawn handle_connection(stream)\n    }\n    \n    return Ok(())\n}\n\nasync func handle_connection(stream: net.TcpStream) -> Result<(), Error> {\n    let mut buf = [0; 1024]\n    let n = try await stream.read(&mut buf)\n    \n    let request = String::from_utf8_lossy(&buf[0..n])\n    print(\"Received request: {request}\")\n    \n    let response = \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\nContent-Length: 13\\r\\n\\r\\nHello, World!\"\n    try await stream.write_all(response.as_bytes())\n    \n    return Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Text Processing\n\nThe standard library includes comprehensive text processing utilities:\n\n```pylang\nimport std.text as text\nimport std.regex as regex\n\nfunc text_processing_example() -> Result<(), Error> {\n    // String operations\n    let message = \"Hello, PyLang!\"\n    print(message.to_uppercase())\n    print(message.replace(\"PyLang\", \"World\"))\n    \n    // Regular expressions\n    let re = try regex.compile(\"\\\\w+@\\\\w+\\\\.\\\\w+\")\n    let email = \"contact@pylang.org\"\n    \n    if re.is_match(email) {\n        print(\"{email} is a valid email address\")\n    }\n    \n    // Text parsing\n    let csv_data = \"name,age,city\\nAlice,30,New York\\nBob,25,San Francisco\"\n    let parser = text.CsvParser::new(csv_data)\n    \n    for record in parser {\n        let record = try record\n        print(\"Name: {record[\"name\"]}, Age: {record[\"age\"]}\")\n    }\n    \n    return Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nThe standard library also includes modules for date and time handling, cryptography, logging, mathematics, serialization formats, and much more. All modules follow consistent design principles and error handling patterns, making them intuitive to use while maintaining PyLang's performance characteristics."}
{"input": "# PyLang Build System and Package Management\n\nPyLang features an integrated build system and package manager called PyLang Package Manager (PPM) that simplifies dependency management and project configuration.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nProjects in PyLang are defined using a `project.pyl` file that specifies metadata, dependencies, and build configurations:\n\n```pylang\n# project.pyl\nproject {\n    name: \"web-service\",\n    version: \"0.1.0\",\n    authors: [\"your.name@example.com\"],\n    description: \"A high-performance web service\",\n    license: \"MIT\",\n    repository: \"https://github.com/username/web-service\"\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    \"http-server\": \"^1.2.0\",\n    \"database-client\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"logger\": \"^0.5.3\"\n}\n\ndev-dependencies {\n    \"testing\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"benchmarking\": \"^0.8.2\"\n}\n\nfeatures {\n    \"metrics\": [\"prometheus-client\"],\n    \"distributed\": [\"cluster-support\"]\n}\n\nbuild {\n    target: \"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\",\n    optimization: \"release\",\n    parallel: true\n}\n```\n\n## Dependency Management\n\nPPM handles dependency resolution, ensuring that compatible versions of all required packages are used. It supports semantic versioning to specify acceptable version ranges:\n\n```\n\"package-name\": \"^1.2.3\"  // Any version >= 1.2.3 and < 2.0.0\n\"package-name\": \"~1.2.3\"  // Any version >= 1.2.3 and < 1.3.0\n\"package-name\": \"=1.2.3\"  // Exactly version 1.2.3\n\"package-name\": \">=1.2.3 <1.5.0\"  // Version range\n```\n\nDependencies can be fetched from the central PyLang Package Registry, Git repositories, or local paths:\n\n```pylang\ndependencies {\n    \"standard-package\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"git-package\": { git: \"https://github.com/user/repo\", tag: \"v1.0.0\" },\n    \"local-package\": { path: \"../local-package\" }\n}\n```\n\n## Build Commands\n\nPPM provides a set of commands for managing the development lifecycle:\n\n```bash\n# Create a new project\nppm new my-project\n\n# Build the project\nppm build\n\n# Run the project\nppm run\n\n# Run tests\nppm test\n\n# Add a dependency\nppm add http-client\n\n# Publish to the package registry\nppm publish\n```\n\n## Workspaces\n\nFor larger projects, PyLang supports workspaces that allow multiple related packages to be developed together:\n\n```pylang\n# workspace.pyl\nworkspace {\n    members: [\n        \"core\",\n        \"api\",\n        \"cli\",\n        \"web-interface\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis allows shared dependencies to be resolved once for the entire workspace, and enables commands to be run across all member packages.\n\n## Build Profiles\n\nPyLang supports different build profiles with appropriate compiler optimizations for each:\n\n```bash\n# Debug build with additional debug information\nppm build --profile debug\n\n# Release build with optimizations\nppm build --profile release\n\n# Size-optimized build\nppm build --profile small\n\n# Performance-focused build\nppm build --profile performance\n```\n\nEach profile configures different compiler settings, such as optimization level, debug information, and link-time optimizations.\n\nThe build system is designed to be extensible through plugins, allowing the community to add support for new platforms, build targets, or integration with other tools."}
{"input": "# PyLang Interoperability\n\nOne of PyLang's key strengths is its exceptional interoperability with existing languages and systems. This allows for gradual adoption and leveraging existing codebases.\n\n## Python Interoperability\n\nPyLang can seamlessly call Python code and libraries using the `@python` annotation:\n\n```pylang\nimport pylang.interop.python\n\n@python\nfunc use_numpy(data: List<float>) -> List<float> {\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(data)\n    return np.sin(arr).tolist()\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    let values = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n    let results = use_numpy(values)\n    print(\"Sine values: {results}\")\n}\n```\n\nPyLang automatically handles the conversion between PyLang and Python data types, making the integration nearly transparent. The PyLang runtime ensures that the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is properly managed when calling Python code from concurrent PyLang contexts.\n\nYou can also embed PyLang code within Python applications:\n\n```python\n# Python code\nimport pylang\n\n# Define a PyLang function\npylang_code = \"\"\"\nfunc fibonacci(n: int) -> int {\n    if n <= 1 {\n        return n\n    }\n    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Compile and execute PyLang code\nmodule = pylang.compile(pylang_code)\n\n# Call the PyLang function from Python\nresult = module.fibonacci(10)\nprint(f\"Fibonacci(10) = {result}\")\n```\n\n## C/C++ Interoperability\n\nPyLang can directly call C and C++ libraries without any runtime overhead using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI):\n\n```pylang\n@extern(\"libc\")\nfunc strlen(s: *const char) -> int\n\n@extern(\"libcrypto\")\nfunc SHA256(data: *const byte, len: int, md: *byte) -> *byte\n\nfunc main() {\n    let message = \"Hello from PyLang!\"\n    let length = strlen(message.as_ptr())\n    print(\"String length: {length}\")\n    \n    // Use OpenSSL's SHA256 implementation\n    let mut hash = [0; 32]\n    SHA256(message.as_ptr(), length, hash.as_mut_ptr())\n    print(\"SHA256 hash: {hash.to_hex()}\")\n}\n```\n\nPyLang also supports embedding C/C++ code directly in PyLang source files for performance-critical sections or when interfacing with existing codebases:\n\n```pylang\n@embed_c\"\"\"\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <time.h>\n\nint get_random_number(int min, int max) {\n    static int initialized = 0;\n    if (!initialized) {\n        srand(time(NULL));\n        initialized = 1;\n    }\n    return min + rand() % (max - min + 1);\n}\n\"\"\"\n\n@extern\nfunc get_random_number(min: int, max: int) -> int\n\nfunc main() {\n    for i in 0..5 {\n        let random = get_random_number(1, 100)\n        print(\"Random number: {random}\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## WebAssembly Support\n\nPyLang can compile to WebAssembly, allowing PyLang code to run in browsers and other WASM environments:\n\n```pylang\n// Compile with: pylc --target wasm32 --export main\n\n@export\nfunc fibonacci(n: int) -> int {\n    if n <= 1 {\n        return n\n    }\n    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n}\n```\n\nThe compiled WebAssembly module can then be used in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript code\nasync function loadPyLangModule() {\n  const response = await fetch('fibonacci.wasm');\n  const bytes = await response.arrayBuffer();\n  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes);\n  \n  const result = instance.exports.fibonacci(10);\n  console.log(`Fibonacci(10) = ${result}`);\n}\n\nloadPyLangModule();\n```\n\nPyLang also provides a higher-level framework for WebAssembly integration that simplifies data conversion and DOM interaction."}
